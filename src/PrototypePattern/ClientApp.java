/***
 * It would be easy to understand prototype design pattern with an example. 
 * Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database. 
 * Now we need to modify this data in our program multiple times, 
 * so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all the data again from database.
 * 
 * 
 * The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then do the data manipulation.
 * Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature. 
 * It should not be done by any other class. 
 * However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties depends on the requirements and its a design decision.
 * 
 * 
 * If the object cloning was not provided, we will have to make database call to fetch the employee list every time. 
 * Then do the manipulations that would have been resource and time consuming.
